Users will be able to report real-time \r\n\t\tinformation about building, path, traffic, construction, and weather conditions. WayPathIO will use GIS data gathered by the Geography department \r\n\t\tat Texas State. For the future, we will potentially implement turn-by-turn navigation, locate high traffic areas, and crowdsource many different \r\n\t\tvariables that may assist with navigating and creating space efficiency at Texas State. Users will be able to calculate travel time between buildings\r\n\t\tand also add detours (coffee, printing homework, visiting office hours, etc.). WayPathIO will be developed first locally and then uploaded onto the\r\n\t\tcs.txstate.edu servers. We will be collecting data from Texas Stateâ€™s GIS department for the geographic locations, using a web mapping framework\r\n\t    (Leaflet, OpenLayers), and using a web framework to create a basic website to host the web application. Tools we will be using are: HTML, CSS,\r\n\t\tand JavaScript. </font>\r\n\t</h3>\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n"},"hash":"4874465b426fec1ba856c989fe8304e3","cacheData":{}}
