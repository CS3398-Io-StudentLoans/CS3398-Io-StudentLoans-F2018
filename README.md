# WayPathIO
**WayPathIO** is a web application that will calculate different paths around the Texas State University Campus. Users will be able to report real-time information about building, path, traffic, construction, and weather conditions. WayPathIO will use GIS data gathered by the Geography department at Texas State. For the future, we will potentially implement turn-by-turn navigation, locate high traffic areas, and crowdsource many different variables that may assist with navigating and creating space efficiency at Texas State. Users will be able to calculate travel time between buildings and also add detours (coffee, printing homework, visiting office hours, etc.). WayPathIO will be developed first locally and then uploaded onto the cs.txstate.edu servers. We will be collecting data from Texas Stateâ€™s GIS department for the geographic locations, using a web mapping framework (Leaflet, OpenLayers), and using a web framework to create a basic website to host the web application. Tools we will be using are: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
